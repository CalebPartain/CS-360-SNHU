This application is used to track items in a warehouse. This application must include the following:

A database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords
A screen for logging into the app. Note that this should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.
A screen, with a grid, that displays all items in the inventory
A mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from inventory
A mechanism by which the user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory
A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to 0 (zero)

My approach to developing this project was a little different to how I usually develop. I usually try to develop by ear for better or for worse. I feel as if I am able to better understand the problems I encounter if I solve them as I am able to test them. This project, I took a slower approach simply because I had no idea what I was doing. I had never interacted with Android studio before. The entire project was very well planned out before any development started. My code had a lot of errors due to my lack of experience. Because of this, I had to ensure that my testing was extensive. To help, I had a other friends and family test my application and play with it until they found a bug. Once I was able to iron out all of those, I went through myself to see if I could break the application. When I felt that the app was solid, I considered the testing to be complete. As mentioned before, my entire project was innovating. In particular, I had to look up a youtube video on how to add a rounded edge to my design. One thing that I feel I had complete control of was the actual designing aspect. Coming from unity, I felt like I already had experience with the design tab.
